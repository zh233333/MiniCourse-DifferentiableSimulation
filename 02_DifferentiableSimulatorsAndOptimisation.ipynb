        "For the following exercises we are going to introduce two JAX libraries which will allow us to easily write and train differentiable simulators:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. diffrax - https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/\n",
        "2. optax - https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html\n",

        "\n",
        "1. ODETerms, these wrap python functions of the form:\n",
        "```\n",
        "def dydt(t : float, y : JAX array, args : dict):\n",
        "    return dydt_val : JAX array\n",
        "```\n",
        "which return the right hand side of your differential equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Solvers, these implement different numerical methods for evolving in time. For example, Euler's method is available as well as other higher order methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Step size controllers, the solvers we will use are adaptive (they vary the time step used) so these controllers are used to decide what step size to take to obtain a prescribed accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "4. SaveAts, these simply provide a number of points in time when the numerical solution should be saved and returned to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using these features, diffrax numerically solves the following equation:\n",
        "\n",
